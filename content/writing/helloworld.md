Welcome.

```rust
// This is a comment, and is ignored by the compiler

// This is the main function, and is also ignored by the compiler
fn main() {
    // Statements here are executed when the compiled binary is called

    // Print text to the console
    println!("Hello World!");
}
// Everything is ignored by the compiler, we just don't know it yet.
// They are free to create anything they desire!
```

Welcome...
