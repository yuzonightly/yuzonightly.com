```rust
// This is a comment, and is ignored by the compiler

// This is the main function, and is also ignored by the compiler
fn main() {
    // Statements here are executed when the compiled binary is called

    // Print text to the console
    println!("Hello World!");
}
// Everything is ignored by the compiler, we just don't know it yet. They are free to create anything they want!
```






`println!` is a macro that prints text to the console.

A binary can be generated using the Rust compiler: `rustc`.

```bash
$ rustc hello.rs
```

`rustc` will produce a `hello` binary that can be executed.

```bash
$ ./hello
Hello World!
```
